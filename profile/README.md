As developers, we are constantly learning and improving our skills. While our older projects may not always reflect our current level of expertise, they are still valuable for several reasons:

### About the Developer

I am an experienced Backend developer and [Opensource](https://github.com/yezz123) Developer, I am mostly **self-taught** and **very passionate about new technologies**. My strongest skills lie within [Python](https://python.org) | [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), both backends, I help founders add value to society by crafting software using Python tools.

Besides technology, I am more passionate about new ideas and new ways of thinking.

Relate to My Passion, I like watching and reading all the things that relate to Ancient Greece, For example, the Dark Ages of the 12th–9th centuries also the Ancient Greek philosophy, Socrates, Aristotle my greatest philosopher of all the time.

#### Mindset 🌠

Back to the world of 0's and 1's, One of the books that made me love that world is [Social Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking by Christopher J. Hadnagy.](https://g.co/kgs/MpXYRt)

> *"From elicitation, pre-texting, influence, and manipulation all aspects of social engineering are picked apart, discussed, and explained by using real-world examples, personal experience, and the science behind them to unraveled the mystery in social engineering."*

#### Opensource Passion ⛏

> *I am lucky. I am intelligent and was not born into poverty. Inherently, I have a responsibility since I am endowed with this gift. I am responsible to do what they cannot because they don't have the same opportunities or privileges as I do. As a result, I dedicate my free time to making the world a better place.*
